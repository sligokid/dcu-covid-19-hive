# Assignment 1 - Cloud App Development
This assignment accounts for 20% of the total marks for this module. The general requirements of this assignment are:

1. Use a cloud data processing technology we have learned about in this course.

2. Include a user interface (web/mobile) where users who give an input to the application can get a responsible output.

3. Use a large public dataset. For example, we can get a dataset from the following links:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
https://data.london.gov.uk/
http://hadoopilluminated.com/hadoop_illuminated/Public_Bigdata_Sets.html
https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/
https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets

4. The application should finally work in the cloud rather than locally.

The final submission should contain the following items:

1. The source code of the application (e.g., Github).

2. A live endpoint in cloud (this is optional).

3. A demo video (screencast on Youtube).

4. A 3-page final report document containing:
(a) Introduction and motivation for the app and the choice of technologies.
(b) What data is used (e.g., source selection, preparation, cleaning, etc.).
(c) What processing is adopted (e.g., processing, querying, storing, etc.).
(d) Challenges and lessons learned.

The above assignment details are available at the end of course 2, Big Data Computing in the Cloud.

Deadline: Monday, 6th April 2020.
